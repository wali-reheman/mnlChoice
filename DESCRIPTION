Description: Provides evidence-based guidance for choosing between Multinomial
    Logit (MNL) and Multinomial Probit (MNP) models based on systematic Monte Carlo
    simulations. Includes decision support functions, empirical benchmark data on
    convergence rates and prediction performance, and robust wrappers for MNP
    estimation that handle common convergence failures.

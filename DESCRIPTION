Description: Provides tools for comparing Multinomial Logit (MNL) and Multinomial
    Probit (MNP) models for discrete choice analysis. Includes empirical benchmarks,
    decision support functions, dropout scenario analysis for testing substitution
    effects, automatic functional form testing, and comprehensive diagnostics.
    Based on systematic Monte Carlo simulations comparing model performance across
    multiple conditions.
